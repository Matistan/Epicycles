# Epicycles

Simple app that draws anything just with circles.

## How does it work?

Click 'New' to create a new path with your cursor.
Once you let go, the program will follow your path with circles moving with a constant speed.

## How to download?

Go to the [release tab](https://github.com/Matistan/Epicycles/releases) and download .jar file.
A few text files are also provided with different paths. These files can be imported to the program.

## Importing files

You can also import files to get the perfect path that cannot be drawn by hand.
The file must be .txt and must contain coordinates X and Y of points in your path.

Example:
<br>

<br>
5.55 0.9

Point (0, 0) is the point in the middle of the screen.
